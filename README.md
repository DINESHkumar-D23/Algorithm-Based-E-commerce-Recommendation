# Recommendation Engine for an E-commerce Platform

This project demonstrates the functionality of personalized product recommendations in an e-commerce platform. The system uses multiple recommendation algorithms that are commonly adopted in real-world industry applications.

The recommendation engine suggests products by analyzing user behaviour, product features, and ratings, and clearly demonstrates how different recommendation strategies work individually as well as in combination.

## Conceptual Overview

This project is algorithm-driven and is not based on deep learning or neural network models.  
The recommendation logic is built using classical machine learning and data-driven algorithms, which continue to form the backbone of many commercial recommendation systems due to their interpretability and efficiency.

The focus of this project is to understand the core working principles of recommendation engines rather than model training.

---

## Project Stages

The system is implemented in the following stages:

1. Data Preprocessing  
2. Content-Based Recommendation Approach  
3. User / Collaborative-Based Recommendation Approach  
4. Hybrid Recommendation Method  

An interactive interface is provided to visualize the output of each recommendation approach separately and understand their behavior.

## Dataset and Preprocessing

The dataset contains:
- Product details  
- User interactions (reviews)  
- Product ratings  

### Preprocessing Steps

1. Cleans the raw dataset  
2. Handles missing and inconsistent values  
3. Structures the data for analysis and recommendation tasks  
4. Resets indices for proper alignment  

This step ensures that the recommendation algorithms receive consistent, structured, and reliable data.

## Recommendation Approaches

### Content-Based Filtering

The content-based approach recommends products based on item similarity.  
Item similarity refers to products that are similar to those a user has previously viewed, searched for, or shown interest in.

#### Key Idea
If a user likes a particular product, the system recommends other products with similar features.

#### Working

1. Product descriptions and attributes are converted into TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectors.  
   This converts textual information into numerical form by measuring the importance of keywords in each product.

2. Cosine Similarity is used to calculate similarity between products by measuring the angle between their TF-IDF vectors.

   Cosine Similarity = A · B / (||A|| × ||B||)

3. Products are compared against the selected product, sorted based on similarity scores, and the top-K most similar products are recommended.

This approach works effectively even when user interaction data is limited.

### Collaborative-Based Filtering

The collaborative-based approach recommends products based on user behaviour patterns.

#### Key Idea
Users with similar interests tend to like similar products.  
If two users have rated several products similarly, then products liked by one user can be recommended to the other.

#### Working

1. A user-item matrix is created where:
   - Rows represent users  
   - Columns represent products  
   - Values represent ratings  

2. Cosine Similarity is used to calculate similarity between users based on their rating patterns.

3. The top-K most similar users are selected to reduce noise and improve recommendation quality.

4. Products rated by similar users but not yet rated by the target user are identified.

5. A weighted scoring mechanism is applied, where ratings from more similar users contribute more to the final recommendation score.

6. Products are ranked based on their final scores and the top-N products are recommended.

This approach captures hidden patterns in user behaviour and improves personalization.

### Hybrid Recommendation Approach

The hybrid approach combines:
- Content-based filtering  
- Collaborative-based filtering  
- Rating-based logic  

By integrating multiple strategies, the hybrid system overcomes the limitations of individual approaches.

#### Advantages of Hybrid Method
- Improves recommendation accuracy  
- Reduces cold-start problems  
- Produces more balanced and reliable suggestions  

This approach closely resembles recommendation strategies used in real e-commerce platforms.

## System Interface

An interactive interface is implemented to:
- Select users or products  
- View recommendations generated by each approach  
- Compare results between content-based, collaborative-based, and hybrid methods  

This helps in understanding how different recommendation techniques behave in practice.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing  
- Scikit-learn for similarity computation  
- Streamlit for interactive visualization  

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following concepts were gained:

- Understanding real-world recommendation systems  
- Implementing content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms  
- Applying cosine similarity and TF-IDF techniques  
- Designing a modular and readable system architecture  
- Bridging theoretical concepts with practical implementation  

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that effective recommendation systems can be built using classical algorithms without relying on complex deep learning models. By leveraging structured data and similarity-based techniques, meaningful personalization can be achieved.

The project provides a strong foundation for understanding advanced AI-driven recommendation systems and can be further extended using modern machine learning or deep learning approaches.
